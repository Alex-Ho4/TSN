Group 6 - The Social Network

to compile after installing opensplice: type 'make' and then './tsn'



MAIN FEATURES TO ADD:

- Threads
- When checking the posts of users, get all of it (aka do it without manually requesting via publisher)
- Add PM quick response (send pm to person who last sent pm to current user)
- Update online users on startup and more often (make it immediately updated so PMs have a name from the start)

TODO BUG FIXES:

- Touch up UI (async notifications mess up menu)
- Make it stop posting online users constantly
- Lock thread when displaying posts and don't show menu until it's done
